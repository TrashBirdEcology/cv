## Key Skills

-   Integrating NASA data, technologies, and capacity into North
    American wildlife management and conservation in a community whose
    organizations often lack the resources necessary to achieve
    conservation targets.
-   Initiating and nurturing relationships with NASA and other key
    domestic organizations (e.g., Department of Defense, U.S. Geological
    Survey, Wildlife Management Institute). As a result, NASA is now a
    recognized and sought-after partner for achieving wildlife
    management and conservation goals in this sector.
-   Well-published life science researcher with 14 publications in top
    Earth science journals, 1 book chapter, 3 software programs, and 4
    government white papers.
-   11+ years of integrating and managing concurrent research projects
    with an emphasis on Earth science, especially wildlife conservation,
    applied geospatial science, scientific programming, and statistical
    modeling.
-   Experienced communicator with strong interpersonal and presentation
    skills enabling effective presentations to and discussions with lay
    audiences, scientific communities, and decision makers alike.
-   6+ years experience designing and implementing multi-year programs
    to answer important scientific questions, generate actionable
    intelligence for end user organizations, create cross-program
    synergies, and advance government agency missions.
-   As a first-time applicant (of over XXX applicants), was awarded the
    prestigious AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowship and one of
    only two (of approx. 275) invited to support NASA Headquarters
    programs.
